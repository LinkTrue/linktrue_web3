# LinkTrue: Cryptocurrency links in bio, with confidence.

LinkTrue unifies your crypto links and wallet addresses on a single page, making it easier to receive crypto donations and tips securely and efficiently.

## Problem

Third-party bio link services seem convenient, but they control your data. You can’t verify their security, and your data might change without your knowledge.

## Solution

LinkTrue ensures data integrity—your data remains under your control, tied to your wallet, and securely stored on the Avalanche C-Chain, preventing tampering.

## Infrastructure

LinkTrue operates on the Avalanche C-Chain, reducing costs while retaining the robust security and decentralization benefits of the Avalanche network.

## Smart Contract

This contract has no owner; all users are their own profile owners. Only they can add or remove their profile data.

## Test

Install required packages:
```sh
yarn run prepare

yarn run test


## Coverage
```sh
yarn run coverage
```
